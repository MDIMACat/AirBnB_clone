# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

Welcome to the second phase of our ambitious AirBnB clone project! In this phase, our journey takes a significant step forward as we shift our focus to the creation of a captivating static website that mirrors the essence of AirBnB's user interface and experience.

## The Vision

Our vision is clear: we aim to recreate the immersive and user-friendly atmosphere of AirBnB on the web, delivering a visually stunning and user-centric platform. By crafting a static website, we're taking the first steps in bringing this vision to life.

## The Web Static

The term "static" may sound unassuming, but don't be fooled. Our web static is the foundation upon which we'll build the entire AirBnB clone. It represents the visual and structural design of our application, without the complexity of dynamic features. Through meticulously crafted HTML and CSS, we'll ensure that every detail of the original AirBnB is beautifully preserved.
